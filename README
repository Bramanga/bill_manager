= Bill Manager

== Abstract

   I often find it difficult to communicate clearly to my roommates about when
   bills are due. In fact, I have even begun sending emails out to my roommates
   as reminders of said bills. But I don't always carry through on these
   promises.

   Enter the Bill Manager. This simple application will allow a user to post
   bill details such as amounts and when they are due, so that the other
   roommates have a centralized location to check for outstanding bills and
   amounts currently owed.
